## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

## Text Formatting

You can _italicize_, **bold**, and `monospace` your text.

### Special Content

Embed videos, tweets, and other content by simply pasting the link (content must be placed in the Nuxt Content
database):

This will only work if you have the appropriate configuration for embedding external content in your Nuxt Content setup.
